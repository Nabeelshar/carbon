# Contributing

If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on GitHub. You don't need to be assigned an issue in order to work on itâ€”consider all issues free rein.

If you'd like to make some changes yourself, see the following:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
1. Make sure yarn is globally installed (`npm install -g yarn`)
1. Run `yarn` to download required packages
1. Build and start the application: `yarn dev`
1. Finally, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) with your changes!

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification, and uses the [@all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) bot to add new contributors. 

Contributions of any kind are welcome!

### Adding themes/languages/fonts

We are not currently accepting new themes, languages, or fonts into Carbon, except for in extenuating circumstances. Instead, we want to continue to provide ways for users to add their own themes and presets. Please feel free to still open an issue or PR for consideration, but know that there is a chance it will get closed without addition.
